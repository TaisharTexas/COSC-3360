HEYA

Please use my last grace day on this. 

This thing has a ton of moving pieces. The master strings get dumped into txt files for your conviencence. The terminal output, while very extensive, is designed to allow you to track my pipe/semaphore ussage throughout the progress of the program as well as what my scheduler algorithm is doing. 

Look for the huge headers that mark where the EDF and LLF runs start


RUNTIME DETAILS:

Please only use the matrix-type inputs (I included the test case Prof Cheng gave us...I followed this template exactly and deviating from its format is gonna break my code).

Its setup to use the argc and argv stuff. Just give it the file names when you run the program. Give the words file (many_words2023.txt) and then the matrix file (many_matrix2023.txt) (in that order).
